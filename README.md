# Tech Stack Brewing

Welcome to [Tech Stack Brewing](https://www.techstackbrewing.com). We are a brewing business with the goal of bringing the worlds of tech and beverages together. We seek to build a fun and inviting community. Something that tech folks would identify with and find enjoyment. There's something special about making new friends at a conference or getting to know coworkers better. Our goal is to connect people together through shared community and delicious beverages. If you'd like to find out more about us, check out our website at [https://www.techstackbrewing.com](https://www.techstackbrewing.com).

Our CLI tool is designed to make it easy to interface with us. Such as finding out information about our company, products and events. In the future we plan to add functionality for placing orders or scheduling events. Who knows, maybe one day soon you can order a beer to get delivered to you all from the command line ;)

If you have ideas for improvements, please feel free to submit an issue or fork this repo and submit a PR.
